**Subject:**         Hello Dear

> Hello Dear,  
> I have emailed you earlier without a response, in my first email I  
> mentioned my client late Mr. Kim , who passed away by  COVID-19  Pandemic  
> in the year 2020, at the age of 71. He left behind $7.2 million unclaimed  
> in his account with our firm. Despite his passing, no one has come forward  
> to claim these funds. I have been instructed as the special account officer  
> by the bank's board of directors to locate the next of kin of the late  
> client in order to release the funds. However, as Mr. Kim did not specify a  
> next of kin in his security file with the bank, I am reaching out to you  
> for assistance. If you are interested in assisting with the claim of the  
> fund let me know so that I can give you more comprehensive details on what  
> to do next.  
> (1)Your full name...  (2) Age....  (3)Country....... (4) Telephone........  
> (5)Personal Email...... (6)Occupation........... (7) Date of birth........  
> Yours faithfully,
